## How to contribute Localization

If you want to localize PayForMe into your language you are very welcome! If unfamiliar, here is a short guide:

To add a new localization, fork the project on github, download it, open it in XCode and then navigate to the Project/Info settings, and add a new localization file there. It is recommended but not necessary to use [iOSLocalizationEditor](https://github.com/igorkulman/iOSLocalizationEditor) then to easily translate all strings. Afterwards, commit and push you changes and open a pull request to the main repository.
